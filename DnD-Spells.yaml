      Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing 
      the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one 
      creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. 
      The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack,
      it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.
      This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. 
      It ends early if you designate a different creature.

        Casting Time: 1 bonus action
        Range: Self
        Components: V
        Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

        The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d10).
